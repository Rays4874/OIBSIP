# 🎙️ Vector AI - Intelligent Voice Assistant

Vector AI is an advanced Python-based voice assistant designed to provide a natural and intelligent user experience through voice interaction, AI-powered conversations, task automation, and system management.

Unlike traditional command-based assistants, Vector AI combines speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, local Large Language Models (LLMs), persistent memory, reminders, weather services, email automation, and a plugin architecture to create a personalized AI assistant.
